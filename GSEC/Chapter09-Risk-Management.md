## Regulatory and Compliance
- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)**: protects investors from egregious accounting irregularities. While it primarily concerns both financial and auditing accountibility, it also involves records, recordkeeping and how public companies behave.
- **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**: set of requirements regulating how credit card data is used, stored and transmitted. The standards surround secure networking, protecting cardholder information, performing vulnerability management, and implementing strong access control mechanisms, among other measures.
- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**: establishment of national standards to protect electronic health care transactions and records. HIPAA defines protected health information (PHI) and specifies how that information needs to be protected.
- **FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)**: requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement information security policies, practices, and infrastructure to protect the information the agency is responsible for.
- **GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act)**: required financial institutions to develop safeguards to protect information provided by, and belonging to, their clients. It also required that these financial institutions perform a risk analysis on every department that handles the non-public information of their clients.
- **FFIEC (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council)**: responsible for developing principles and standards for the examination of financial institutions in accordance with the Federal Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act (FIRIRCA) of 1978.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: Even though it was passed by the European Union (EU), it impacts companies around the world because any company who may have customers who live in the EU has to comply with the GDPR. It provides regulations for protecting information of consumers that may be stored or handled by a data processor or a data controller.

While every country in the world has their own judicial system and ways of applying laws and punishments, there are two common legal systems: **common law and civil law**. 

Common law is based on precedents set through legal rulings by judges or courts, and is founded upon the idea that it is unfair to apply different standards to different cases. Civil law, on the other hand, is based on statutes that have been passed by legislative bodies, or on regulations that have been issued by the executive branch. Both types of legal systems can have an impact on your organizationâ€™s operations and risk assessment.
