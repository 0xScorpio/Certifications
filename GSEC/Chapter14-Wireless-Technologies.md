Frequency spectrum allocation is crucial due to a finite spectrum space and avoidance of collisions.

Think of the **spectrum as a range of frequencies**, and a **frequency as an individual sliver within the spectrum**.

## Modulation and Carrier Waves

If you think about a traditional radio with FM and AM, there is a particular frequency that you tune into, a **channel**. What you are really tuning into is a **carrier signal**. The carrier signal is a particular frequency that is changed or modulated based on the information the carrier is expected to be transmitting. Let’s use FM as an example. Because FM is Frequency Modulation, we use a specific carrier frequency, say, 94.9 MHz. The MHz part is megahertz, meaning that the wave is cycling a million times per second. So we have a wave that’s cycling 94,900,000 times per second. On top of that, we want to carry music and voice. The range of frequencies typically spans 20 to 20,000 Hertz (Hz), since that’s generally the range of human hearing. However, a wide variety of hearing ranges exists from one person to another.

In order to carry the sound signal, which uses a range of frequencies considerably lower than the carrier signal, we modulate the carrier based on the input. The instantaneous frequency of the input is combined with the carrier and the result is transmitted. On the receiving end, since the carrier wave is known, the difference between the carrier frequency and the actual frequency is the signal that was used as the input. This signal can then be sent through a set of speakers that convert the signal to audio waves, which can be heard by human ears. The thing is, though, **the carrier frequency needs to have space on either side for the carrier to be modulated**, otherwise you run into issues of crosstalk between the two signals. You’ll hear this in cases where you are crossing out of the range of one radio station and into that of another. The carrier frequency is really in the center of the range on either side. Instead of a wave that has a steady frequency, the frequency is constantly changing.

## Antennas and Transmissions

In order to send the signal out, you need an antenna. The antenna is responsible for **taking an electrical signal and converting it to electromagnetic waves and vice versa**. Any device that communicates using electromagnetic radio waves requires an antenna. 

Antennas are made of conducting materials that convert the waves into electrical signals—which is caused by the waves exciting the electrons in the antenna—resulting in current flowing through that antenna. If you are using your antenna to transmit instead of receive, you send a current out the antenna, and the excited electrons generate both a magnetic field and an electric field. The two together become the wave transmitted from the antenna. Because the antenna is expected to respond to the wave in order to excite the antenna’s electrons so they move, the best way to achieve that is to have the antenna resonate with the frequency the antenna is expected to receive. If the antenna resonates with the receiving frequency, the antenna will oscillate faster, meaning the electrons will respond better (move faster), giving you more gain on the antenna. This requires the antenna to be matched to a particular frequency, which isn’t always possible, considering that many antennas are expected to work with a range of frequencies.
