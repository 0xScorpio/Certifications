## Accreditations

The GSEC certification and several other GIAC certifications are accredited under ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024. This is a standard that has criteria for operating a Personnel Certification Body. The GIAC has to adhere to requirements for developing and maintaining a certification.

The Department of Defense Directive (DDoD) 8140 approves certifications that demonstrate a baseline set of knowledge for information assurance. Along with a number of other certifications, DoDD 8140 approves the GSEC. DoDD 8140 relates to full- and part-time personnel who have privileged access to DoD information systems.
