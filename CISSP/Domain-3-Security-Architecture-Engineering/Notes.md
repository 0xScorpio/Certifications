# Security models and concepts
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): gives subjects full control of objects they have created or been given access to.
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): system-enforced control based on subject's clearance and object's labels.
- Role Based Access Control (RBAC): access to objects based on the role of the subject.
- Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC): access to objects based on attributes/conditions of the subject/object.
- Rule Based Access Control (RUBAC): access granted based on IF/THEN logical statements.

### Bell-LaPadula (Confidentiality) (MAC)
- Simple Security Property: NO READ UP
- * Security Property: NO WRITE DOWN
- Strong * Property: NO READ/WRITE UP AND DOWN
