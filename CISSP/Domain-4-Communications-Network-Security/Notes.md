# Networking Basics
**Terms**
- **Simplex**: a one-way communication (one system transmits, the other system listens)
- **Half-duplex**: communication sends/receives at one-time only (only one system can transmit at a time)
- **Full-duplex**: communications sends/receives simultaneously (both systems can transmit/receive)
- **Baseband**: have 1 channel and can only send 1 signal at a time. (Ethernet, STP cable)
- **Broadband**: multiple channels and can send/receive multiple signals at a time.
