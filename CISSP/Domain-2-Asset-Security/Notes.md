# The Information Lifecycle
- Data Acquisition: information is either created or copied from another location.
- Data Use: How do we ensure the data is kept confidential, integrity is intact and available at need.
- Data Archival: Retention required by law or data will be used later.
- Data Disposal: How do we dispose properly of the data once it is no longer useful and required.

# States of Data
- Data at REST: stored data. (Full disk encryption)
- Data in MOTION: data transferred on a network. (Encrypt network traffic, both internal and external)
- Data in USE: actively using data. (No shoulder surfing, clean desk policy, print policy, locking screens)
