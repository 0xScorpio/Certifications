## CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring no unauthorized user can access the data.
- **Integrity**: Ensuring the data in rest/motion/used has not been altered or modified.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized people can access the data that they need, when they need.
## Opposing DAD Triad
- **Disclosure**: Someone unauthorized gaining access to information they shouldn't.
- **Alteration**: Data in rest/motion/used being changed.
- **Destruction**: Data or systems have been destroyed or rendered inaccessible.

Finding the right mix of CIA is a balancing act since:
- Excessive Confidentiality may cause Availability to suffer.
- Excessive Integrity may cause Availability to suffer.
- Excessive Availability may cause both Confidentiality and Integrity to suffer.

## IAAA
- **Identification**
- **Authentication**: KNOW, HAVE, ARE
- **Authorization**: What access are you authorized to have?
- **Accountability**: tracing an action to a subject's identity - also known as non-repudiation.
