 # Designing security in our software

- **SDS (Software-Defined Security**
  - security functions are removed from the hardware and become virtual network functions (VNFs) instead.
  - SDS is software-managed, thus policy-driven and governed security where most controls are automated and monitored by software.

- **Auditing/Logging of Changes**
  - need to be clear with change/configuration management

- **Risk Analysis & Mitigation**
  - Identify, Analyze, Mitigate
 
 # Programming concepts
- Machine Code
- Source Code
- Assembler Languages
- Compiler Languages
- Interpreted Languages: similar to compiler but interprets code each time it is run into machine code.
- Bytecode: interpreted code, in intermediary form, converted from source, but still needs to convert to machine code before it can run on the CPU.
- Procedural Languages: uses subroutines, procedures and functions.
- Object-Oriented Programming

- CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering)
  - similar, inspired by CAD tools for hardware
  - used to develop high-quality defect-free and maintainable software
  - CASE software is classified into 3 categories:
    - **Tools** support specific tasks in the software lifecycle.
    - **Workbenches** combine 2 or more tools focused on a specific part of the software lifecycle.
    - **Environments** combine 2 or more tools or workbenches and support the complete software lifecycle.

 - **Top-Down Programming**
   - Starts with the big picture, then breaks it down into smaller segments.
   - Each subsystem in the overview, is then refined in greater detail, sometimes with additional subsystems.
   - Procedural programming leans towards Top-Down, you start with one function and add to it.
     
 - **Bottom-Up Programming**
   - Piecing together of systems to build more complex systems. The individual base systems are specified in great detail, then linnked together to form a larger subsystem, until a complete top-level system is formed.
  - OOP tends to lean toward Bottom-Up; start by developing your objects and then build up.
