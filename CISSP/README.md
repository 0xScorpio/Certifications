You will also be asked to provide your relevant work experience (requirements vary by certification) and can also provide any experience waiver based on certifications held or higher education degrees completed.

All candidates who pass an ISC2 credential examination must complete the certification application process within nine months of their exam date.

You will be notified via email if your application is selected for audit.
